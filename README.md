# Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree - Project 1

This is my final submission for the Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree Project 1 - Facial Keypoint Detection
The goal was to build a neural network for facial keypoint detection. I trialed various different combinations of optimisers and
network architectures in pytorch.

# Technical Details

- pytorch 0.4.0
- CNN Deep Learning Models
